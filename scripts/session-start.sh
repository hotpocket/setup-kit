# SessionStart hook, wired via .claude/settings.json. Stdout is injected into
# the agent's context at session start, making vault orientation deterministic
# instead of prose-dependent. Cheap by design — pointers only, never full bodies
# (the agent reads the recap/todo files on demand).
#
# Fully file-based: it delegates to scripts/vault-digest, which is pure grep/awk
# over the vault's .md files. NO Obsidian app/CLI/GUI is touched, so it's safe
# headless and parallel sessions in different repos never contend over Obsidian.
